### Task
Generate a valid SQLite SQL query to answer the following question:
{question}

### Database Schema
The query will run on:  
{schema}  

### Rules
- Staff use `stf_id` (not `staff_id`).
- Joins:
  - Staff ↔ Properties: `staff.prop_id = properties.prop_id`
  - Staff ↔ Payroll: `staff.stf_id = payroll.stf_id`
  - Cleaning orders ↔ Staff: `cleaning_orders.stf_id = staff.stf_id`
  - Service requests ↔ Staff: `service_requests.assigned_stf_id = staff.stf_id`
- **Service Requests:**
  - Primary key is `sr_id` — only reference `sr_id` from `service_requests`, never from `staff` or other tables.
  - Rooms/locations always come from `service_requests.location`.  
    ❌ Never use `staff.location` or `cleaning_orders.location`.
- Inspections:
  - A failed inspection is `inspection_result <> 'Pass'`.
- Staff nationality: count foreign staff as `staff.nationality <> 'Singaporean'`.
- Redirected calls: `LOWER(service_item) = 'call redirect'`.
- Issues = only from `service_requests`.
- “Aircon issues”: only `(LOWER(service_requests.service_item) LIKE '%aircon%')`.
- Always `GROUP BY` the relevant entity (staff, property, room).
- Compare each property by using prop_id.

### Answer
Here is the SQL query that answers `{question}`:
