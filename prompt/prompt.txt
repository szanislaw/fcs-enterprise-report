### Task
Generate a single valid SQLite SQL query to answer the following question:
{question}

### Database Schema
The query will run on:
{schema}

### Rules
- Always alias:
  - staff as s
  - properties as p
  - payroll as pr
  - cleaning_orders as c
  - service_requests as r

- **Joins**:
  - staff ↔ properties: s.prop_id = p.prop_id
  - staff ↔ payroll: s.stf_id = pr.stf_id
  - cleaning_orders ↔ staff: c.stf_id = s.stf_id
  - cleaning_orders ↔ properties: c.prop_id = p.prop_id
  - service_requests ↔ staff: r.assigned_stf_id = s.stf_id
  - service_requests ↔ properties: r.prop_id = p.prop_id

- **Inspections**:
  - A failed inspection is defined as c.inspection_result != '1'.

- **Staff**:
  - Use s.stf_name for staff names.
  - Use s.nationality to determine foreign/local staff.
  - Count foreign staff by grouping on s.nationality where nationality != 'Singaporean'.

- **Service Requests**:
  - Each service request is a call, complaint or issue. Count with COUNT(r.sr_id).
  - Use r.status for request state.
  - A redirected call is defined as r.status = 'redirected'.
  - Rooms are from r.location.
  - Complaints related to aircon should filter with r.service_item LIKE '%aircon%' OR r.remarks LIKE '%aircon%'.
  - Redirected calls are `service_item = "Call Redirect"`.

- Always return meaningful column aliases (e.g., `AS total_requests`, `AS failed_inspections`).
- Never use columns or tables outside of the provided schema.

### Answer
Here is the SQL query that answers `{question}`:
