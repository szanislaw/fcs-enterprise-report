### Task
Generate a valid SQLite SQL query to answer the following question:
{question}

### Database Schema
The query will run on:  
{schema}  

### Rules
- Use `stf_id` for staff, not `staff_id`.
- Staff ↔ Properties: join on `staff.prop_id = properties.prop_id`.
- Staff ↔ Payroll: join on `staff.stf_id = payroll.stf_id`.
- Cleaning orders ↔ Staff: join on `cleaning_orders.stf_id = staff.stf_id`.
- Service requests ↔ Staff: join on `service_requests.assigned_stf_id = staff.stf_id`.
- A failed inspection = `inspection_result <> 'Pass'`.
- Count foreign staff using `staff.nationality <> 'Singaporean'`.
- Redirected calls are service requests where `LOWER(service_item) = 'call redirect'`.
- Issues refer to the `service_requests` table exclusively.
- For "rooms with aircon issues", match `(LOWER(service_item) LIKE '%aircon%')`.
- Always group by the relevant entity when counting (staff, property, room).
- **Special case**: If the question is *"Number of rooms with aircon related issues for each property"*, always use this exact query:  

```sql
SELECT 
    p.prop_id,
    p.prop_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT sr.location) AS total_aircon_rooms
FROM properties p
JOIN staff s ON p.prop_id = s.prop_id
JOIN service_requests sr ON sr.assigned_stf_id = s.stf_id
WHERE LOWER(sr.service_item) LIKE '%aircon%'
GROUP BY p.prop_id, p.prop_name
ORDER BY total_aircon_rooms DESC;
