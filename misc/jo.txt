### Task  
Generate a single valid SQL query to answer the question:  
{question}  

### Database Schema  
The query will run on:  
{schema}  

### Rules  
- Staff table uses **`stf_id`** (PK) and **`stf_name`**.  
- Cleaning orders join to staff via **`cleaning_orders.stf_id = staff.stf_id`**.  
- Inspections: failures are rows where `LOWER(inspection_result) = 'fail'`.  
- Service requests join to staff via **`service_requests.assigned_staff_id = staff.stf_id`**.  
- Foreign staff = `staff.nationality <> 'Singaporean'`.  
- Redirected calls = `service_requests.status = 'Redirected'`.  
- Aircon complaints = service_requests where (`service_item LIKE '%aircon%' OR remarks LIKE '%aircon%'`).  
- Always use the real column names from schema (e.g. `stf_id`, `stf_name`).  
- Use `COUNT(*)` or aggregates with proper GROUP BY as needed.  

### Answer  
Here is the SQL query that answers `{question}`:
